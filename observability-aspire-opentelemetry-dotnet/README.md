The app consists of four .NET services:

- **AspireShop.Frontend**: This is an ASP.NET Core Blazor app that displays a paginated catalog of products and allows users to add products to a shopping cart.
- **AspireShop.CatalogService**: This is an HTTP API that provides access to the catalog of products stored in a PostgreSQL database.
- **AspireShop.CatalogDbManager**: This is an HTTP API that manages the initialization and updating of the catalog database.
- **AspireShop.BasketService**: This is a gRPC service that provides access to the shopping cart stored in Redis.

The app also includes a .NET class library project, **AspireShop.ServiceDefaults**, that contains the code-based defaults used by the .NET service projects.
